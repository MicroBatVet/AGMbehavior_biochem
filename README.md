This data repository is to provide example data and the R code used for the data analysis for the thesis "Enriching Well-Being: Exploring the complexities between enrichment interventions and the stress response of African green monkeys (*Chlorocebus sabaeus*)".  

It is divided into two sections as two manuscripts arose from the thesis.  

The example data and R code for analysis of the first manuscript, *Assessing Stress in African Green Monkeys through Novel and Classical Salivary and Blood Biomarkers*, is under the folder <ins>Biochemical_Analysis<ins>.

The example data and R codde for anlaysis of the second manuscript which is still in draft, is under the folder <ins>Behavior_Analysis<ins>.

This initial version of this repository (v1.0) has a digital identifier (DOI) generated to allow citation within the first manuscript.  Updates will be posted as the second manuscript is drafted and accepted for publication.
